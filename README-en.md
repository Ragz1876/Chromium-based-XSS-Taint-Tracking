![avatar](cyclops.ico)**Cyclops is a web browser with XSS detection feature**   

📝[中文说明](https://github.com/v8blink/Chromium-based-XSS-Taint-Tracking/blob/main/README.md)   

The Cyclops's binary code can be directly [downloaded here](https://github.com/v8blink/Chromium-based-XSS-Taint-Tracking/releases); It's source code is not provided now.    

Cyclops is open evaluation for Microsoft Windows 10; Versions for Linux and Mac will be published soon.

# User Manual
Cyclops is still in development. If any problem occurs, please contact us.  
When using Cyclops, arg "**--no-sandbox**" is needed. If any suspicious XSS is detected, a log file named "SourceSink.txt" will be generated in running directory (Default:C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Chromium\Application\97.0.4684.0\). The format of SourceSink.txt will be introduced below.  

[DEMO video 1](https://www.zhihu.com/zvideo/1505471657166282752)，[DEMO video 2](https://www.zhihu.com/zvideo/1505847898797969409)          
**Note** Cyclops updates frequently so newly-developed features may not be included in the videos above.

# To do list   
Ordered by priorities  
**0. id field must be included in sink info.**    
E.g. "Sink:HTMLLIElement.className" without id field will display as Element type, and it must display its id if it is not null. This feature is in progress...
**1.source and sink**
Currently, the supported sources and sinks are as follows:  
|source|sink|
|----|----|
|document.baseURI|element.innerHTML  
|document.URL|document.cookie   
|document.referrer|element.innerText  
|location.href/a.href|element.className     
|location.hash|element.href   
|location.host|element.src  
|location.hostname|document.write()  
|location.pathname|document.writeln()  
|location.search|window.alert()  
|document.domain|window.setTimeout()  
|document.cookie|window.setInterval()
|document.documentURI|window.postMessage
|element.textContent|document.createElement()
|document.title|
|element.classname|
|element.namespaceURI|
|element.src|

**2.crash error fix**    
Our test cases only cover limited scenarios, so we will be appreciated if you raise an issue when encountering a crash.   
**3.optimization for SourceSink.txt**   
The current format of SourceSink.txt is temporary. We intend to output it as JSON or redirect it to a specific port. But limited by our finite ability and the complexity of Chromium's architecture, we have not solve the crash problem yet.   
We are trying to implement our thoughts.   

# Description of SourceSink.txt  
Each line of the file is a record of sink, with three parts divided by comma. The first part is sink info; The second part is a test ID; The third part is the source of the data, with embeddable units enclosed with [].
Here is an example listed below:
>[Sink:alert:qerwr , 910226, [ENURI:[Substring:[Location.search]]]]


"Sink:alert:qerwr", divided by colon, with "alert" as its destination method name, and its parameter is string "qerwr";  
910226 represents to a test ID;    
[ENURI:[Substring:[Location.search]]] describes the data source of the parameter of method "alert". alert(EncodeURI(location.search.substring()));

>[Sink:HTMLLIElement.className ,910226, [Trim:[ADD:[ADD:[ADD:,[HTMLLIElement.className]],],]]]
  
Sink:HTMLLIElement.className  divided by colon, represents the termination of the data is a className property of an Element.    
910226 represents to a test ID;    
[Trim:[ADD:[ADD:[ADD:,[HTMLLIElement.className]],],]]] ADD means operator +; If an operand does not contain tainted info, it will be an empty string "".
 
**Note** Test ID 910226 must be with data source. A test id without data source or data source without test id is a bug. Bug report around this issue will be appreciated.
"Trim" and "ENURI" in the examples above are abbreviation marks used in Sink data flow. Full abbreivation mark table is listed below.

|Mark|JavaScript function|Direction|Illustration|
|----|----|----|----|
|A|string.anchor|[A:strX]|`<a name=undefined>strX</a>`|
|B|string.big|[B:strX]|`<big>strX</big>`||
|Blink|string.blink|[Blink:strX]|`<blink>strX</blink>`||
|Bold|string.bold|[Blod:strX]|`<b>strX</b>`||
|Fontcolor|string.fontcolor
|Fontsize|string.fontsize
|Fixed|string.fixed

|Link|string.link  
|Small|string.small
|Strike|string.strike
|Sub|string.sub|
|Sup|string.sup|
|Pad:,S=|string.padStart|  
|LC|string.toLowerCase|
|Substring|string.substring|
|DURI|decodeURI|  
|DURIC|decodeURIComponent|  
|ENURI|encodeURI|
|ENURIC|encodeURIComponent|
|Escape|escape|
|UnEscape|Unescape|
|Geval|eval method|
|Deval|eval method|
|ADD|addition|[ADD:strX,strY]|missing operand(s) means no tainted info|
|Pad:,E=|string.padEnd|[Pad:strx,E=strY]|b=strX.padend(num,strY), it will be recorded if the value of b differs from that of strX|  
|Rep:rec=,s=|strin.replace|[Rep:rec=hello,s=world]|strX.replace("hello","world"), find the "hello" substring from strX and replace it with substring "world"|  
|Repeat|string.repeat|[Repeat:strX]|Repeat times are currently not recorded. It will be updated soon|
|Slice|string.slice|[Slice:strX]|b=strX.slice(i,j)，when the length of b is greater than zero and less than strX, it will be recorded|
|Substr|string.substr|[Substr:strX]|refer to the above example| 
|Trim|string.trim|Does not distinguish trimStart, trimEnd, trimLeft and trimRight   
|Concat|string.concat|[Concat:strX,strY] or [Concat:strX,strY,strZ...]|b=strX.concat(strY),b=strX.concat(strY,strZ...)       
|gAttr|element.getAttribute()|[gAttr:name:value]|e.g. `<input id=name value='huidou'/>`, method "input.getAttribute('value')" generates the record, represents that the data comes from a "value" property of an Element, whose id is "name"。
|sAttr|element.setAttribute()|[sAttr:name:value]|same as the above example, represents to a write action to the "value" property of an Element, whose "id" is name
|F:P=,B=|Function() constructor|[F:P=p1,p2,B=evil]|P represents parameter, p1 and p2 represents data source of the two parameters;B represents the data source of the function body. Generates this record if P or B is attacker-controlled.   

**Note** common properties/methods such as location.href, settimeout and alert are not listed above because they just simply use their full names.
